    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Did you know that some of the best breakfast items in China are flaky pastries and layered pancakes? 
    Chinese street food is the inspiration behind this quick sheet pan breakfast recipe for Chinese eggs in puff pastry!
    A bed of flaky pastry, seasoned with salt, five spice powder, and scallions, studded with sesame seeds and topped with
    eggs. It gets baked in the oven until the eggs are still a little runny, and it’s all topped with a salty, umami-packed 
    soy sauce and chili oil drizzle. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup toasted seasame seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon five-spice powder</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chopped scallion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon light soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon chili oil, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </li>
        <li>Lightly flour your work surface. Roll out puff pastry sheet into a 12x16-inch rectangle using a rolling pin, about ⅛ inch
            thin. Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet and fold over the edges to form a ½-inch wide crust. </li>
        <li>Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of water to make an egg wash. Brush egg wash onto the puff pastry to help the sesame 
            seeds and scallions adhere. Use a fork to poke holes all over the middle of the puff pastry. Score the inner edge 
            of the crust with a paring knife. </li>
        <li>Sprinkle sesame seeds liberally over the crust. then sprinkle salt and five spice powder evenly over the center of 
            the puff pastry. (Sprinkle from higher up to make sure it’s evenly distributed.) Follow with a little over half of the scallions. </li>
        <li>Pre-bake puff pastry in the preheated oven until puffed up and lightly browned, 20 to 22 minutes. Remove from the oven and use a spoon 
            to make 6 indentations into the pastry evenly spaced apart. Crack an egg into each indentation. </li>
        <li>Bake puff pastry and eggs for an additional 6 to 10 minutes, depending on how runny or firm you like your yolks. Keep in mind, they will 
            continue to cook a bit after you take them out of the oven. </li>
        <li>Mix soy sauce and chili oil, and drizzle evenly over the eggs. Top with the remaining scallions, cut into 6 pieces, and serve! </li>
    </ol>
