    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Did you know that some of the best breakfast items in China are flaky pastries and layered pancakes? 
    Chinese street food is the inspiration behind this quick sheet pan breakfast recipe for Chinese eggs in puff pastry!
    A bed of flaky pastry, seasoned with salt, five spice powder, and scallions, studded with sesame seeds and topped with
    eggs. It gets baked in the oven until the eggs are still a little runny, and itâ€™s all topped with a salty, umami-packed 
    soy sauce and chili oil drizzle. </p>
